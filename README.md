## Purpose: 

This project is a sandbox to learn the Next JS framework combined with Vercel.  This is the beginning stages of development of this basic boilerplate into a blog site with a Chat bot integrated down the line.
The goal is to develop a fluency in the Next JS framework, and see if its present state reduces the need for multiple systems in order to make it a functioning full stack.

## Description

Basic front end App.  Just a sandbox for me to get better acquainted with NextJS, React dynamic page development, Tailwinds CSS...

This project originated on the  <a href='https://vercel.com/'> <strong>Vercel </strong></a>

It is an instance of clone Next.js basic boilerplate template.

Problems with the build have been:

![ScreenShot](./app/(home)/assets/Screen1.png)
1.  The build was not working.  Developed a package-lock discrepency.  Finally buils a dupliate repo, then added the updates back into this repo.  Want t keep this one up online. 
   
2.  cannot get the updated main to update on the deployment.  I do not want to delete the deployment and start over, but as of now cannot find the disconnect between my push modifications and the production deployment.



### Run instructions for basic build from Next JS

 1. Clone the repo
 2. Add dependencies (review package.json)
 3. Begin local editing
 4. pnpm run dev
